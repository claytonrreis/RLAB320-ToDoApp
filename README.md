**📝 New To-do App 📝**
Welcome to the New Home To-do App! 🎉 This simple and intuitive to-do list application helps you keep track of your tasks, with the ability to dynamically change the header title. Let's dive into the features and get started! 🚀

**Features**
Add New Tasks 🆕: Easily add tasks to your to-do list.
Mark Tasks as Complete ✅: Toggle tasks between completed and incomplete.
Delete Tasks ❌: Remove tasks from your list.
Move Tasks Up/Down ⬆️⬇️: Reorder your tasks with ease.
Dynamic Header Title ✏️: Change the header title to whatever you want, and it will be saved even if you refresh the page.
How It Works
Header Title: The title of the to-do list can be changed by entering a new title in the input field and submitting the form. The new title is saved in localStorage, so it remains even after refreshing the page. 📝

Complete/Undo Task: Click the checkmark button to mark a task as completed or to undo the completion. ✅
